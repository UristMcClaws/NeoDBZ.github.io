The Short: Every character starts with 500 credits to make any purchases they want. Characters gain an additional 100 credits per day, automatically. Fighting also grants more credits.

Items may be sold back for half their original price if they are undamaged. Damaged or destroyed items cannot be sold back. Items that have an improved version of the same item - such as Weighted Clothes 1, Dragon Radars and Rejuvenators can be upgraded to the next version by paying the difference cost.

For example; Weighted Clothing 2 is 1000 Credits. Instead of having to fork out the full amount, if you already own Weighted Clothing 1, you could pay the difference of 600 credits, lose your WC1 but gain the WC2.

Trivial items that do not affect game mechanics, such as mundane clothing and shoes, do not cost enough credits to have a noticable effect on a character's wealth. They're essentially free.

The Long: Credits

Credits are magical gems about 3" in diameter. When credits come into contact with one another they fuse, their magical properties keep them the same shape and allow for them to be split apart as needed by the owner.

Credits must be carried around on a person, if they are set down somewhere then they magically unsplit and shatter. However, safes can be purchased which have properties to keep them bundled together. Unfortunately, this also makes it possible for credits to be stolen from a person.

All characters begin with 500 credits, plus another 100 each neo week (real life day). New characters begin with 500 credits, plus 100 credits every full 24 real hours of the reset they missed.

Fighting also grants extra credits, as the gems absorb excess chi from battles. How they do this is unknown and does not always seem to occur. See Chapter 10, Section 1: Spoils of War for more details on how many credits are awarded from combat.

Money is earned per full 24 hours since the beginning of the reset. There is no penalty or bonus for starting your character at a weird hour of the day. If the Reset begins at 5 PM on the 5th, then at 5 PM on the 15th, all characters who have done nothing to alter their credit total (spent or received money in any fashion) will have 1,500 credits.

Weapons
Standard Weapons:

All weapons, except the small weapon, may be used with sword powers. Weapons are melee only; ranged weapons are ineffective against people as strong as those in the Neo Universe and with exception to the small weapon, no weapons may be used in a grapple. Otherwise, you may design your weapons to be whatever you want it to be or look like. You may not upgrade one Weapon to another.

Switching from sword or unarmed or one sword to another costs you no actions, because you're so quick with them!

1) Light Weapon - 200 credits 1d10 damage per level, +3 to strike, gives a +4 bonus, instead of +3, when used with the sword power "Parrying Strike". Example Weapon: Bo Staff

2) Medium Weapon - 240 credits 1d10 damage per level, SP, +2 to strike. Example Weapon: Long Sword

3) Heavy Weapon - 280 credits 3d10 damage per level, AP, +30% base damage on Basic attacks Example Weapon: Bastard Sword Template: {(Sword Damage + Ki Enhance + STR Mod)x1.3+Misc+Bulk}

4) Giant Weapon - 300 credits 2d10 damage per level, AP/SP, -3 Strike. Example Weapon: Great Axe

5) Sharp Weapon - 400 credits 3d10 damage per level, SP Example Weapon: Katana

6) Balanced Weapon - 350 2d10 damage per level, AP, +2 Strike, -1 END Cost on all attacks (min 1). Example Weapon: Short Sword

7) Small Weapon - 320 credits 1d10 damage, AP. This weapon can be used in grapples! It cannot be used with any sword powers except ki enhance. Ki enhance can be activated on this weapon at any time insted of being limited to preround, when it is being used to only enhance the blade and not for its ki attack. In place of the normal ki enhance damage bonus, it insted gains 1d10 damage per five ki spent, to a max of five ki per user's level. The Sword Power ki enhance must be obtained before this option can be used. Once it is used it gains the bonus to damage for the rest of the round.

Daggers do not gain the benefit of level scaling damage, they are always 1d10 damage unless you ki enhance them. Ki-Enhancement Powers "Bulk" and its upgraded forms may be used with it. Example Weapon: Dagger

Note In a defensive position in a grapple, the ki enhance benefit of the dagger cannot be used automatically. However, If the ki enhance was paid for preround, or anytime earlier in the round, it is in effect.

Scouters
Scouters are used to detect the ki signatures of other warriors. Scouters may be used once every ten real life minutes to detect someone's power level, or once per preround if used in combat. The roll to determine if you receive a successful reading or not is (Scouter % chance)-1d100, where a 0 or higher is a success. Scouters cannot lock on to another warrior in combat without addons.

If you are wearing a scouter and it breaks, it deals you no actual HP damage, but that doesn't mean it didn't hurt.

1) Level 1 - 50 credits 70% chance of success, breaks if it reads a PL of 30,000 or more.

2) Level 2 - 100 credits 80% chance of success, breaks if it reads a PL of 60,000 or more.

3) Level 3 - 175 credits 90% chance of success, breaks if it reads a PL of 120,000 or more.

4) Level 4 - 400 credits 100% chance of success, breaks if it reads a PL of 240,000 or more.

5) Level 5 - 750 credits 125% chance of success, breaks if it reads a PL of 480,000 or more.

6) Level 6 - 1,000 credits 200% chance of success, never breaks. This scouter allows you to save a specific aura it scans into data, so that it can recognize it at a later date (even if the power level is at a different number than before). It may store up to four auras, and no more. It cannot store the auras of androids to memory in this fashion, because they lack auras.

Scouter addons:

Androids and Ghettis may purchase these addons and have them added to their racial scouters.
Combat locking: 1200 credits. This addon DOES NOT stack with a ki sense lock. This ability allows the scouter to lock onto anything it can detect, this includes androids. The scouter tracks movements in combats and gives locations, because of this you gain +1 to all strikes and dodges. This ability DOES NOT stack from round to round like locking does. You gain nothing more than the +1.

Communicator: 400 credits This adds a communicator unit that can contact any scouter on the same planet. This can also be used to communicate to dwellings, androids or other players with a scouter. To reply to someone who has contacted you with a scouter, you require the communicator addon.

Trinkets
Trinkets are some personally significant item that has been enhanced (through technology, magic, or something else that costs credits) to provide some benefit. It costs 1000 Credits to Enhance a Trinket, and it provides one of the following benefits.

+10 INT
+5 MNT
+15 STR
+5 DEX
+10 STM
+5 SPD
+Level x5 Sword Damage
+Level x 5 Hand-to-Hand Damage
+Level x5 Ki Damage, except Telekinetics
+Level x 5 Telekinetic Damage
+Level x 3 Resistance
+Level x 3 Ki Regeneration
+Level x 2 HP Regeneration
+1 APR
A character may only benefit from one trinket at a time. Once you receive a trinket's benefit for the battle, you may not change it until that battle is over. Stat bonuses are applied -after- anything that multiplies your stats, such as most superforms.

--=( Senzu Bean )=-- May not be purchased This is the rare and hard to aquire Senzu Bean. Very few shops are able to sell this plant, so purchasing one is extremely difficult or expensive. Eating this bean will restore 50% of your HP, Ki, End and cure any critical effect that does not involve a lost limb the victim is suffering from. You would however, ignore penalties associated with a lost limb for that fight. It takes an action to chew and swallow. A character in LP or SLP given this item are brought up to 1 HP and their LP/SLP are both restored to full. A dead character cannot benefit from this item. Using a Senzu Bean in anything but a Deathmatch or Guild War incurs a -100 XP Penalty. If you feel this penalty does not count for a team fight you intend to use it for, you may speak with a GM.

--=( Flying Nimbus )=-- May not be purchased A small, semi-sentient cloud. This little cloud comes at the calling of its name and them the owner can then ride or stand on it for travel. It can fly at the owner's MNTx30 MPH and can be used in a fight with no ki cost to the user, but must be declared preround. A Flying Nimbus can be 'killed,' - it has HP equal to the owner's levelx100 and any ki attacks that hit the person riding it also deal an additional 25% of their damage to the cloud, which does not reduce the damage dealt to the rider and does not decrease if the rider shields all or part of the damage. If 'killed', the Flying Nimbus poofs away and will regenerate back to full HP a Neo week (1 Real life day) after it has been destroyed and is once again available for use.

--=( Spacesuits )=-- 500 credits per suit Whatever race, size, gender or style. Spacesuits are the new fashion statement for races without immunity to death. Or so it's advertised. When worn, you're immune to any atmosphere-based hostile environents. In a fight, you may use armor with a spacesuit providing it is worn over the spacesuit. If you're ever reduced to 0 HP, the suit is considered 'ruptured' and you lose LP and End, as if you were exposed to the hostile environment while you are unconcious. Suits cost nothing to fix, once you're awake, not wearing it and in a safe place. Suits may be patched with a repair kit, if no safe place is available, detailled below.

--=( Suit Repair Kit )=-- 100 credits per consumable. A small toolkit box with last-ditch survival tools. You may seal a spacesuit up from the hostile environment by using up one of these kits. Obviously you must be concious to use one.

Dragon Radars
Dragon Radars are used to detect Dragon Balls, items of mythical power that are said to grant wishes. Dragon Radars are generally a flat, circular object with a display on the large portion and a button to activate them on the top - which makes them woefully simple to operate even if you didn't read the manual. The exact mechanics of how a Dragon Radar works is unknown, except to a select few scientists and engineers who might not even give you a good answer if you asked.

The Radars themselves are far from perfect, however and there's a chance when used that they fail to pick up a signal. To determine if a Dragon Radar finds any Dragonballs, roll (Radar% chance)-1d100, where a 0 or higher is a success. If a person in the chatroom possesses a dragonball that can be detected by this roll, they are required to reply with a 'ping' in whisper. If you think people are purposely withholding rolls or conveniently AFKing, you can contact a GM to resolve it.

Each type of Radar may only be used once per every real-life day. Because of the limitations of OpenRPG/Discord, if a player rolls in one room and wishes to check another room for dragonballs, he may have a new roll for the new room.

1) Cheap Dragon Radar - 1,000 credits 15% chance of success.

2) Dragon Radar - 1,750 credits 30% chance of success.

3) Improved Dragon Radar - 3,000 credits 50% chance of success.

Armor
There are four different types of armor, and each type of armor comes in four Ranks. Select the Rank you want, spend that amount of credits, and you gain the benefits appropriate to that rank. The costs and benefits are seperated by a slash. So a Rank 3 Namekian Armor costs 1200 Credits, has 900 Armor, and grants Levelx3 Ki Regeneration. Each type of armor has a different "Special" Benefit. When you wear Armor, this special benefit applies until the end of the combat, even if the armor loses all of its HP.

--=( Repairing Armor )=--

Repairing a suit of armor costs half its full cost in Credits, but restores it to full health. Armor that has been completely destroyed is gone and must be repurchased completely.

--=( Upgrading Armor )=--

You may upgrade armor by paying the difference in cost in credits.

--=( Stacking Armor )=--

You may only wear one armor from this section, which incures EXP penalties. This is in addition to any armor granted by your race and powers.

--=( Armor Types )=--

Humans Armor The human race has spread across the galaxy, it only makes sense that their technology does as well. The human armor is white, devoid of metal, it covers almost the entire body except the head. It evokes feelings of the ancient astronauts of the past except far more slender. It tends to be made with plastics and hypertextiled spidersilk (produced by the finest of hybrid cloned goats of course). Cost: 300 / 600 / 1200 / 2400 Credits Armor: 300 / 600 / 900 / 1200 HP Special: +10 / +20 / +30 / +40 Resistance

Kuwain Armor The Kuwain armor is similar to the saiyan armor - it feels soft, it has battleplate motifs, however almost all their designs center from a off palate colored diamond found in the center of the back/chest. It is also more solid, made of a flexable metallic feeling substance which fits around the user like a breastplate - open it up, step in, close it, seal the latches. Cost: 300 / 600 / 1200 / 2400 Credits Armor: 400 / 800 / 1200 / 1600 HP Special: None

Namekian Armor Namekian armor is nothing special, seeming to be nothing more than a turban, a cape, or a robe. However it has a touch of mysticism as a result of their spiritual nature, crafted out of their mental energies in a condensed form, it can prove to far surpass expectations Cost: 300 / 600 / 1200 / 2400 Credits Armor: 300 / 600 / 900 / 1200 HP Special: +Levelx( 1 / 2 / 3 / 4) Ki Regeneration

Saiyan Armor Saiyan battle armor feels much like a flexible version of kevlar, the material designed into plates which link together with or without shoulderpads. It is often intimidatd to borrow from its primary user's ability for intimidation and effiency. It is one thing a race of warriors get right, its their battle gear, keep it simple and keep it effective. Cost: 300 / 600 / 1200 / 2400 Credits Armor: 250 / 500 / 750 / 1000 HP Special: +Levelx( 2 / 3 / 4 / 5) to all Damages

Ships
If you wish to upgrade your ship, you may pay the difference in cost to upgrade, which is roleplayed as a part-exchange for the new ship. If a ship loses HP, it can be repaired for 1 credit per 10 HP it has. A ship with 0 HP has been damaged beyond repair and no longer functions. When a ship is destroyed and someone is inside, the ship takes the full damage that destroyed it (including excess that might be considered to go onto the occupant) and its original maximum HP is dealt in SP/AP damage to each individual inside.

For obvious reasons, none of the listed ships below are capable of having a Dwelling inside them or a Guild Haven and vise versa.

1) Pod Ship - 200 credits Podships are little more than spheres used to send a single person from point A to point B, with barely any space for storage. Podships are very basic and have no communications equipment or anything similarily advanced. Navigation in podships is limited to telling the computer to go to a point, and it will do so automatically as best it can. Podships have 50 resistance, 250 HP and travel 0.5 light years per hour. A podship fits only a single person.

2) Capsule Corps Ship - 500 Credits Capsule Corps Ships are larger than podships, and much more spacious. Despite this, CapCorp ships act as a podship in most other ways, they have equal technology and navigation abilities. CapCorp Ships are, however, well-known for the ability to be micro-sized into a pea-sized tablet which easily fits in a pocket, which can later be inflated back to full size again with the push of a button. For an extra 100 credits, it can have some space made and fit with a Rejuvenator. Capsule Corps ships have 75 resistance, 500 HP and travel 1 light year per hour. CapCorp ships can fit up to two people.

3) Light Star Cruiser - 1500 Credits Light Star Cruisers are the ship types that are used for 'light' travel, whether military scouting trips or a rich boy's joy ride. These vary in size and shape but are significantly larger can CapCorp ships, and much more advanced. This ship type has working communications equipment, sensors to detect other ships and the like. It can even be manually pilotted, but the average individual will just use the autopilot. Light Star Cruisers have 150 resistance, 1000 HP and travel 3 light years per hour. These ships can fit up to four people and has enough room to hold a rejuvenator, which must be acquired seperately. Due to its speed and firepower, it can easily destroy ships of smaller classes than itself.

4) Heavy Star Cruiser - 3500 Credits Heavy Star Cruisers are the largest type of ships that can be considered 'personal' ships and are sometimes restricted from sale. Most military fighters are just barely larger than the average ship of this type. These ships tend to sport slightly more advanced equipment than their lighter cousins, having working communications, sensors, better navigation abilities and the like. These ships can also be manually pilotted, but the ship's computer probably does it better than you ever could. Heavy Star Cruisers have 225 resistance, 1500 HP and travel 4 light years per hour. These ships can fit up to eight people and has enough room to hold two rejuvenators, which must be acquired seperately. Due to its speed and heavy firepower, it can easily destroy ships of smaller classes than itself. 

Weighted Clothing
Weighted clothing costs 200 credits to purchase.

Wearing weighted clothing during a fight gives you -2 to all strikes and dodges. If you go the entire fight without dropping your weighted clothing you gain an additional 50 experience for the fight.
To wear weighted clothing you must have 30 STR.
At level 10 you may upgrade to weighted clothing level 2 for 800 credits, this gives you -4 to all strikes and dodges while worn, when dropped it gives you +4 bonus to all strikes and dodges for each round previously worn. You also gain an additional 100 EXP if you wear it for the whole fight.
To wear weighted clothing level 2 you must have 100 str.


Dropping Weighted Clothing: When you remove your weighted clothing you gain +2 to all strikes and dodges based on how many previous rounds you wore the weighted clothing for. Example: Sanchez wears his weighted clothing for the first two round and is getting his ass kicked, so he decides to remove it in round 3, gaining +2 to all strikes and dodges in rounds 3 and 4. If he was level 10 with level 2 weighted clothing he would gain -4 and +4 in the previous example. Weighted clothing must be declared pre-round in your initiative. You must spend an action to drop your weighted clothing, this can not be done pre-round.

Dwellings
Dwellings are the homes and bases of solitary Neo DBZ warriors. Although they do not have to be a house, exactly, dwellings are intended to be places where the owner lives or spends their time resting. Dwellings are always something physical, such as a structure or a cave, that can be destroyed or broken into.

Each character may only own a single dwelling and only the owner benefits from the furnishings and add-ons (not including Rejuvenators). Their friends may still visit and enter, of course. Since only the owner can benefit from it, dwellings may not be stolen in any fashion. When buying or owning a Dwelling, ensure the details are recorded somewhere on your sheet for referance.

Selling a dwelling is possible, but you do not get the value of the addons returned - only the value of the Dwelling itself and any rejuvinators it might have.

If a group of characters wish it, they may combine their dwellings and become "housemates". This does not mean that the total HP + resistance is combined, but it is now shared between your two properties. This still does not allow them access to your addons, but it does give them access to your Dwelling (meaning they can buy their own addons). Several characters living together under one roof is a good basis for forming a guild. For obvious reasons, a Dwelling cannot be placed inside a Guild Haven and vise versa.

Dwellings are not spacious enough to fight inside of. If a fight occurs within a dwelling, ki blasts deal full damage to the dwelling regardless of whether they hit their target or not. Hand-to-hand and sword attacks deal damage to the dwelling if they miss their intended target.

Should you ever wish to Enter or Exit a Dwelling during a fight (bare in mind it should already exist in the scene and not be destroyed); you need to spend 2 consecutive actions entering or exitting the Dwelling. For all other information, follow the normal guidelines for Fleeing.

Should you ever wish to destroy/attack a Dwelling, the owner or housemates (if present) can interrupt your attack. If they are unavailable to defend it, you're free to do so. Make sure you know the house doesn't possess the Capsule addons, before attacking. If it does have the capsule addons, it usually means it stays with its owner most of the time. Destroying a Dwelling without the Safe addon drops any valuables it had inside it.

Should you ever wish to steal from a Dwelling, you're free to do so providing the owner or housemates (if present) can interrupt you. Otherwise, it is dependant on if the house possesses a secure enterance or a safe. Safe's are uncrackable personal vaults in NeoDBZ and prevent theft from Dwellings.

Basic Dwelling - 300 credits This must be purchased before any other dwelling add-ons. This is the structure of a dwelling, the most basic thing that could be considered a 'home' of any sort, although it is not required to be a building. Only one Dwelling may be owned at any one time by one person, nor can you buy this multiple times for stacking effect. Basic dwellings start with 500 HP and 0 resistance. If the Dwelling is ever damaged, it may be repaired at the rate of 1 credits per 10 HP. Once it has been brought to 0 HP, the dwelling and all dwelling add-ons within in it are permanently damaged beyond repair.

Pretty Dwelling - 1000 credits An optional upgrade from the Basic Dwelling or Bought for full price as its own kind of house. Maybe the architecture is particularly grand or the interior is luxurious. Whatever the case, it is simply better than its cheaper counterpart. Only one Dwelling may be owned at any one time by one person, nor can you buy this multiple times for stacking effect. Pretty dwellings start with 1500 HP and 50 resistance. If the Dwelling is ever damaged, it may be repaired at the rate of 1 credits per 10 HP. Once it has been brought to 0 HP, the dwelling and all dwelling add-ons within in it are permanently damaged beyond repair.

Reinforced Dwelling - 3000 credits An optional upgrade from the Basic Dwelling, Pretty Dwelling or Bought for full price as its own kind of house. This sturdy building is reinforced to the brim with powerful icons and is simply better than most in every field. Not only that, but you've made sure to include training space so you can fight inside without damaging the Dwelling and still benefit from whatever you add onto your house, which can optionally (only during the fight) be included for your opponent to enjoy - this doesn't give them access to your safe to store money, for example, but they could benefit from your Increased Healing: Ki addon. Only one Dwelling may be owned at any one time by one person, nor can you buy this multiple times for stacking effect. Reinforced dwellings start with 2000 HP and 100 resistance. If the Dwelling is ever damaged, it may be repaired at the rate of 1 credits per 10 HP. Once it has been brought to 0 HP, the dwelling and all dwelling add-ons within in it are permanently damaged beyond repair.

Advanced Dwelling - 2000 credits An optional upgrade from the Basic Dwelling, Pretty Dwelling or Bought for full price as its own kind of house. This house is the pinnicle of modern science and economical to boot. You might not enjoy some luxuries others enjoy, but you have your ways. Whenever an addon is purchased for an Advanced Dwelling, you're actually getting double your money's worth! You gain two of the item (not Rejuvenators, though it does allow for two to be installed), up to its normal maximum limits. Not to mention it's reasonably tough. Only one Dwelling may be owned at any one time by one person, nor can you buy this multiple times for stacking effect. Advanced dwellings start with 1500 HP and 50 resistance. If the Dwelling is ever damaged, it may be repaired at the rate of 1 credits per 20 HP. Once it has been brought to 0 HP, the dwelling and all dwelling add-ons within in it are permanently damaged beyond repair.

Table of Contents

Rejuvenator Addition - 300 credits This addition allows you to install a Rejuvenator inside your dwelling. This ability can only be purchased once. Rejuvenators do not stack with the Increased Healing: HP Improvement. However if your Rejuvenator does not grant ki regen you may benefit from increased Healing: Ki.

Structure Improvement - 30 credits This improves the dwelling's HP by 10 each time it is purchased.

Structure Reinforcement - 10 credits This improves the dwelling's resistance by 1 each time it is purchased.

Secure Entrance - 10 credits Any character may enter any dwelling without this add-on without impediment. Once this is purchased, it requires anyone who wishes to forcefully enter to deal the Dwelling damage equal to 5% of its maximum HP before they may enter. This may be purchased multiple times, each time increasing the amount of damage that must be dealt by 5%, to a maximum of 95%. Such security is always one-way. Characters cannot imprison others in their dwelling with this add-on.

Capsule Dwelling - 300 credits The Dwelling may now be micro-sized into a pea-sized tablet which easily fits into a pocket. It can later be inflated back to full size again with the push of a button. It will not inflate in a space it cannot fit in. This upgrade is incompatible with Safe, Secure Enterance and the Rejuvenator Addition. If stolen, the dwelling will re-inflate as soon as it has enough space to. This may only be bought once.

Improved Capsule Dwelling - 500 credits The Dwelling, when micro-sized, may now hold any number of items when it shrinks which will not be damaged. This add-on requires that Capsule Dwelling already be bought and may only be bought once. It unlocks the previous restrictions Capsule Dwelling possessed.

Communications Equipment - 15 credits While normal houses might come with a telephone, caves and log cabins in the wilderness do not. Comm equipment is some fairly advanced technology that lets you communicate with any other dwelling that also has this add-on, or anything else with similar comm equipment. You cannot force another dwelling to listen to your transmission, however. This may only be bought once.

Scramble Effects - 50 credits per level This add-on, whether through rare types of insulation or advanced technology, lowers the chance to detect someone in their dwelling, either with scouters or the Sense Ki power, by 5%. This also causes anyone within a dwelling with this addon, the same penalty to sense or scout those outside of it. This affects everyone inside the dwelling and not just the owner. This does not alter the chances of success for Dragon Radars. This can be purchased multiple times, to a maximum of once per every experience level of the owner, each time lowering the chance of detection by an additional 5%.

Increased Healing: HP - 500 credits Whether through proper medical stores, a pet medical bot, a really nice natural hot spring that happens to bubble up in your dwelling, or anything else the player wishes, this increases the owner's healing rate inside the dwelling by +5% of his maximum HP per Neo hour. This may only be bought once. In rare circumstances, this can even be used in combat, which grants the owner level*2 HP per action he's inside the building.

Increased Healing: Ki - 500 credits Whether through some really inspiring feng shui, a personal meditation chamber, or anything else the player wishes, this increases the owner's healing rate inside the dwelling by +5% of his maximum Ki per Neo hour. This may only be bought once. In rare circumstances, this can even be used in combat, which grants the owner levelx2 Ki per action he's inside the building.

Safe - 50 credits Normally, credits cannot be left sitting on the ground without them dispersing into whatever magic causes them to have their value. Once this is purchased, a character may choose to store 5% of their total credits in their dwelling instead of carrying them around with him. This may be purchased multiple times, each time increasing the storage capacity of the safe by another 5%, up to a maximum of 80% credit storage. Credits not stored in safes must be carried by the character. If a character is robbed of all his credits and he has a safe at his Dwelling, he cannot be robbed again until he gets a chance to fully recover (from the fight, if there was one). He must also take enough credits out of his safe so that it only contains its maximum % of his wealth. If someone destroys a Dwelling with the Safe addon, the Safe is left intact and cannot be stolen or stolen from. Because of magic.  Speaking of Magic, I wish we had a space boat.
